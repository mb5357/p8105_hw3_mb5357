## QUESTION 1

**Description of the Instacart Dataset**

The `instacart` dataset is a line-item level table of grocery orders from Instacart, where each row represents a single product in a single order.

The dataset contains 13,844,617 observations and 15 variables. 

Key variables include `order_id`, `product_id`, `user_id`, `add_to_cart_order` (position of the item in the cart), `reordered` (0/1), `order_dow` (day of week), and `order_hour_of_day`. Orders are categorized by `eval_set`, and user purchase history is captured via `order_number`. 

The dataset can be joined with metadata tables such as `products`, `aisles`, and `departments` using `product_id`. In this version of the dataset, all observations come from the "train" evaluation set. 

For example, user 112108 placed their 4th order on day 4 of the week at 10 AM. This order (order ID 1) contained eight products, including "Bulgarian Yogurt", "Organic Celery Hearts", and "Organic Hass Avocado". Each product appears in a separate row, with variables indicating the order in which the item was added to the cart (e.g., "Bulgarian Yogurt" was first), whether it was reordered (1 = yes, 0 = no), and what aisle and department it belongs to (e.g., "fresh fruits" in the "produce" department).


**Number of aisles and most ordered aisles**

```{r}

aisle_counts <- instacart |>
  count(aisle, 
        name = "orders", sort = TRUE)

total_aisles <- nrow(aisle_counts) 

aisle_counts |>
  mutate(total_aisles = total_aisles) |>
  relocate(total_aisles, .before = aisle)

```

*There are 134 aisles in total. Fresh vegetables and fresh fruits aisles are the most items ordered from.*


**Plot of items ordered per aisle**

```{r,  fig.width=10, fig.height=8}

    y = "Aisle"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```


**Top 3 items in selected aisles**

```{r}

top_items_table <- instacart |>
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | 
         aisle == "dog food care" | 
         aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") |>

   mutate(day_name = factor(day_names[order_dow + 1], 
                             levels = day_names)) |>
   
   group_by(product_name, 
           day_name) |>

## Question 2

**Import and Clean the datasets**

```{r}


zipcodes_df <- read_csv("Zip Codes.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    zip_code = str_pad(as.character(zip_code), 
                       width = 5, 
                       side = "left", 
                       pad = "0"),

  distinct(zip_code, .keep_all = TRUE)


zori_df <- read_csv("Zip_zori_uc_sfrcondomfr_sm_month_NYC.csv", 
                    show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("x20"), 
    names_to = "date", 
    values_to = "zori"
  ) |>
  rename(zip_code = region_id, 
         region_name = region_name, 
         county = county_name) |>
  mutate(
    zip_code = str_pad(as.character(zip_code), 
                       width = 5, 
                       side = "left", 
                       pad = "0"),
    date = ymd(str_remove(date, "x")),
    zori = as.numeric(gsub(",", "", zori)),   
    year = year(date),
    month = month(date),
    county = case_when(
    county == "New York County" ~ "Manhattan",
    county == "Kings County" ~ "Brooklyn",
    county == "Richmond County" ~ "Staten Island",
    county == "Queens County" ~ "Queens",
    county == "Bronx County" ~ "Bronx",
    TRUE ~ county)
  ) |>
  select(zip_code, region_name, county, date, year, month, zori)


combined_df <- left_join(zori_df, zipcodes_df, by = "zip_code") |>
  mutate(county = coalesce(county.x, county.y)) |>
  select(zip_code, county, region_name, date, zori) |>
  rename(borough = county)

```


**ZIP Codes Observation**

```{r}

zip_counts <- combined_df |> 
  group_by(zip_code) |> 
  summarize(n_months = n()) |> 
  ungroup()

zip_counts |>
  summarize(
    full_coverage = sum(n_months == 116),
    very_sparse = sum(n_months < 10)
  )

```

A total of 149 ZIP codes have complete data, appearing in all 116 months from January 2015 to August 2024. Conversely, 0 ZIP codes are observed fewer than 10 times during this period. ZIP codes with full coverage likely represent stable residential areas with consistent rental activity and reliable data reporting. Those with sparse observations may reflect areas with limited rental market activity, newer ZIP codes, or data gaps.


**Average rental price per borough and year**

```{r}

borough_year_table <- combined_df |>
  select(date, borough, zori) |> 
  mutate(year = year(date)) |> 
  group_by(borough, year) |> 
  
   summarize(avg_rent = mean(zori, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
 
   arrange(borough, year, avg_rent) |>
 
   pivot_wider(
    names_from = borough,
    values_from = avg_rent
  )

borough_year_table |> 
  kable()

```

From 2015 to 2024, average rental prices steadily increased across all boroughs with available data. Manhattan consistently exhibits the highest rents, followed by Brooklyn and Queens. The Bronx has the lowest average rents but demonstrates notable growth over the period. Data for Staten Island begins in 2020, showing a similar upward trend. Overall, the table reflects a citywide rise in rental prices, with Manhattan and Brooklyn leading both in cost and growth.


**NYC rental prices within ZIP codes**

```{r,  fig.width=10, fig.height=8}

library(ggplot2)

plot_1 <- combined_df |>
  filter(!is.na(zori)) |>
  mutate(year = year(date)) |>
  
  ggplot(aes(x = year, 
             y = zori, 
             group = zip_code, 
             color = borough)) +
  
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +                      
  stat_summary(aes(group = borough),              
               fun = median, 
               geom = "line", 
               color = "black", 
               size = 1) +
  
  facet_wrap(~ borough, scales = "free_y") +     
  
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks=seq(2015, 2024, by = 2)) +
    
  labs(
    title = "NYC Rental Prices by ZIP Code Across Boroughs",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Rental Price (ZORI)",
    color = "Borough"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "none")

plot_1


```

From 2015 to 2024, average rental prices rose in all NYC boroughs, with a dip or slowdown around 2020â€“2021 likely reflecting pandemic effects. Rents began rising sharply again in 2022. Manhattan consistently had the highest average rents, while the Bronx saw the largest relative increase. By 2024, the gap between boroughs had narrowed somewhat, suggesting prices are rising more quickly in outer boroughs. Staten Island data is available only from 2020 onward.


**ZIP-Code level Rent**

```{r,  fig.width=10, fig.height=8}

plot_2 <- combined_df |>
    filter(!is.na(zori),
           year(date) == 2023) |>
  
  group_by(borough, 
           zip_code, 
           date) |>
  
  summarize(avg_rent = mean(zori, na.rm = TRUE), 
            .groups = "drop") |>

        ggplot(aes(x = borough, 
              y = avg_rent, 
              fill = borough)) +
  
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +   
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, 
              alpha = 0.3, 
              size = 1) + 
    labs(
    title = "Distribution of Zip-Code-Level Rental Prices by Borough in 2023",
    x = "Borough",
    y = "Average Price ($)",
    fill = "Borough"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")


plot_2


```

The boxplot shows clear differences in ZIP-level average rents across boroughs in 2023. Manhattan has the highest median ZIP rent and the greatest dispersion, with a wide interquartile range (IQR) and a long upper tail driven by several very high-rent ZIP codes. Brooklyn follows, with a relatively high median and substantial variability. Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island have lower and more similar medians, with Staten Island showing the narrowest IQR, indicating more uniform ZIP-level rents. A few outliers with extremely high rents are visible, likely due to luxury listings or data anomalies.


**Combined Plots**

```{r}

library(patchwork)

combined_plot <- plot_1 / plot_2 

ggsave("results/combined_plot.png", combined_plot, width = 10, height = 8)

```


## Question 3

**Import and Clean the datasets**

```{r}

accel_df <- read_csv("nhanes_accel.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("min"),
    names_to = "minute",
    values_to = "mims"
  ) |>
  mutate(minute = as.integer(str_remove(minute, "min")))



sex_levels <- c("male", "female")
education_levels <- c("Less than high school", "High school equivalent", "More than high school")

covar_df <- read_csv("nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4, show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  mutate(
    sex = case_when(
      sex == 1 ~ sex_levels[1],
      sex == 2 ~ sex_levels[2],
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    ),
    
    education = case_when(
      education == 1 ~ education_levels[1],
      education == 2 ~ education_levels[2],
      education == 3 ~ education_levels[3],
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    )
    
  ) |>
  filter(age >= 21) |>

  mutate(
    sex = factor(sex, levels = sex_levels),
    education = factor(education, levels = education_levels, ordered = TRUE)
  )


nhanes_df <- left_join(accel_df, covar_df, 
                       by = "SEQN") |>
             drop_na(sex, age, education)


```


**Number of men and women in each education category**

```{r,  fig.width=10, fig.height=8}

sex_dist_table <- covar_df |>
  count(education, sex) |>
  
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sex,
    values_from = n,
    values_fill = 0
  )

sex_dist_table |> 
  kable()

```

The table shows a fairly even gender distribution across education levels. Most participants have more than a high school education, with women slightly outnumbering men in that category. Men are more represented in the high school equivalent group, while the lowest education level is nearly balanced. Overall, the sample leans toward higher educational attainment for both sexes.


**Visualization of Age Distributions**

```{r,  fig.width=10, fig.height=8, message=FALSE}

library(ggridges)

ggplot(covar_df, aes(x = age, 
                     y = education, 
                     fill = sex)) +
  
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5, 
                      scale = .85) +
  labs(
    title = "Age Distributions by Sex and Education Level",
    x = "Age",
    y = "Education Level",
    fill = "Sex"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")


```

The visualization shows how age distributions vary across education levels for men and women. Higher education groups peak around ages 30â€“40, while lower education groups include more older adults (65+). Within each education category, male and female age distributions largely overlap, though women tend to be slightly older, especially in the "Less than high school" group.


**Aggregate total activity per participant**

```{r}

total_activity_df <- nhanes_df |> 
  group_by(SEQN, sex, age, education) |>
  
  summarise(total_mims = sum(mims, na.rm = TRUE), 
            .groups = "drop")

```


**Plot total activity vs age by sex and education**

```{r,  fig.width=10, fig.height=8, message=FALSE}

ggplot(total_activity_df, 
       aes(x = age, 
           y = total_mims, 
           color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  
  facet_grid(~ education) +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
  
  labs(
    title = "Daily Total Activity by Age, Sex, and Education Level",
    x = "Age",
    y = "Total MIMS (Daily Activity)",
    color = "Sex"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

The plot shows daily total physical activity by age, sex, and education level. Activity generally declines with age across all groups, but patterns differ by education. In "Less than high school," activity drops sharply, with women slightly more active than men. For "High school equivalent" and "More than high school," women consistently maintain higher activity than men, and declines with age are more gradual, especially in the highest education group. Overall, females tend to stay more active, and higher education displays a pattern of a slower decline in activity with age.


**Three-panel Plot**

```{r,  fig.width=10, fig.height=8, message=FALSE}


nhanes_df <- nhanes_df |>
  mutate(hour = minute / 60)


ggplot(nhanes_df, aes(x = hour, 
                      y = mims, 
                      color = sex, 
                      group = sex)) +

 stat_summary(
    fun = mean,
    geom = "line",
    linewidth = 1,
  ) +

  geom_smooth(
    se = FALSE) +

  facet_grid(~ education) +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
   
  scale_x_continuous(
   breaks = seq(0, 24, by = 4)) +
  
   labs(
    title = "24-hour Activity Profiles by Education Level and Sex",
    x = "Hour of Day",
    y = "Mean MIMS (Activity Level)",
    color = "Sex"
  ) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

The plot shows mean physical activity (MIMS) over 24 hours, separated by sex and education level. In all groups, activity increases in the morning, peaks mid-day, and declines at night, reflecting typical daily routines. Women consistently show higher activity than men, especially among those with more than a high school education. This group also maintains higher afternoon activity levels. While men follow a similar pattern, their activity levels are lower overall. These trends highlight consistent differences by sex and education, particularly in daytime activity.
